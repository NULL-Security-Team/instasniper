Usage: php script.php username pass.txt proxies.txt

# Notes

This script needs PHP cURL, if you don't have it installed, install it with the commands below.

Install with:
`sudo apt-get install php-curl`

And then restart apache 
`sudo service apache2 restart`

It also needs proxies, make sure to put some on the "proxies.txt" file.
